/// <reference types="react-scripts" />

// This file allows the TypeScript compiler to use the types and definitions
// from the 'react-scripts' package, which comes with Create React App (CRA).

// These types provide autocomplete, type-checking, and better developer experience
// for features such as service workers, environment variables, and more.
