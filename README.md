# Carbon Footprint Tracker

## Description

The Carbon Footprint Tracker aims to be an enterprise-grade web application that enables businesses to track and manage their carbon emissions, with an added focus on supply chain sustainability. It provides detailed insights into emissions across different scopes (Scope 1, 2, and 3), helping users reduce their environmental impact while improving operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Track Emissions**: Track Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (indirect), and Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions for businesses.
- **System Management**: Add and categorize systems such as workflows, vendor solutions, and vehicles to get a clear breakdown of emissions sources.
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: AI-driven recommendations for cost-saving and environmental optimizations.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Gain insights into potential future emissions and areas for improvement.
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication.
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: View detailed emissions data and performance in real-time via interactive charts and reports.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete organizations and systems in a seamless UI.
- **Cloud Hosting Ready**: Deployed and scalable on AWS or Azure infrastructure.

## Tech Stack
